**Title**  
KJV Rightly Dividing: Study the Word Without Mixing Law and Grace

---

**Body (paste into Blogger post)**

**Rightly dividing the word of truth (2 Timothy 2:15, KJV)** means separating what was given to Israel under the law from what God says to the church today through Paul’s grace gospel. Mix them, and you get either legalism or a watered-down gospel.

**KJV Rightly Dividing** is a free, simple web app that helps you do exactly that.

**How it works**

1. You type a question—e.g. “How are we saved today?” or “Should Christians tithe?” or “What did Jesus say about forgiveness?”
2. The app routes your question to the right categories: Paul’s grace, Jesus’ teachings (red letters), Law/Israel, human traditions vs truth, and when needed, a Galatians-style warning about mixing law and grace.
3. You get only **KJV verses**, grouped with clear labels like [Paul’s Grace], [Jesus’ Kingdom Offer], [Law/Israel].

No sign-up, no app store—just open the link and study.

**Why it matters**

- **Law vs grace:** Moses’ law (sabbath, tithing, circumcision, etc.) was for Israel and is a shadow; we are not under law but under grace (Rom 6:14, Col 2:14–17).
- **Jesus vs Paul:** Jesus’ earthly ministry was to Israel; for the church today, Paul is the apostle of the Gentiles (Rom 11:13, 1 Tim 2:7). His epistles are our doctrine.
- **Traditions vs truth:** The app can surface verses that contrast human tradition with Scripture (e.g. Mark 7, Col 2:8).

Try it with questions you care about—salvation, tithing, baptism, Sabbath—and see how the same Bible, rightly divided, keeps the gospel clear.

**Hi [First name],**

“Study to shew thyself approved unto God … rightly dividing the word of truth.” — 2 Timothy 2:15 (KJV)

A lot of confusion in Bible study comes from mixing what was for Israel under the law with what God says to the church today through Paul’s grace. **KJV Rightly Dividing** is a free web tool that helps you keep that divide clear.

**How it works**

1. You type a question—e.g. “How are we saved today?” or “Should Christians tithe?” or “What did Jesus say about forgiveness?”
2. The app routes your question to the right categories: Paul’s grace, Jesus’ teachings (red letters), Law/Israel, human traditions vs truth, and when needed a Galatians-style warning.
3. You get only **KJV** verses, grouped with labels: [Paul’s Grace], [Jesus’ Kingdom Offer], [Law/Israel], etc.

No sign-up, no app—just open the link and study.

**Try it:** [YOUR_URL]

If you care about law vs grace, Jesus’ words to Israel vs Paul’s gospel for the church, this tool is for you. Pass it along to anyone who wants to study the word rightly divided.

Rightly dividing the word isn’t just a phrase—it’s how we avoid mixing law and grace.  
KJV Rightly Dividing helps you see at a glance:  
→ What’s for Israel under the law  
→ What Jesus said in His kingdom offer  
→ What Paul teaches the Body of Christ today  
Ask things like “How are we saved?” or “Should we tithe?” and get KJV verses labeled by category. No sign-up. [YOUR_URL]

“Study to shew thyself approved … rightly dividing the word of truth.” — 2 Timothy 2:15 (KJV)  
A lot of confusion comes from mixing what was for Israel under the law with what’s for the church under grace.  
KJV Rightly Dividing is a simple tool: you type a question, it shows you only KJV verses, sorted by Law/Israel, Jesus’ teaching, Paul’s grace, traditions vs truth, and a Galatians-style warning when the question touches law + grace.  
Try “How are we saved today?” or “What about tithing?” and see the difference.

**Thread 1 (opener)**  
Rightly dividing the word = not mixing law and grace.  
KJV Rightly Dividing: you ask a question, it shows you KJV verses by category — Paul’s grace, Jesus’ teaching, Law/Israel, traditions vs truth.

**Thread 2 (follow-up)**  
Example: “How are we saved today?”  
→ You get Eph 2:8–9, Rom 3–4, Gal 2:16–21, plus a Galatians warning so we don’t add works to faith.  
Another: “Should Christians tithe?”  
→ Law (tithing was to Israel), traditions, then Paul’s grace — so you see the full picture without confusion.

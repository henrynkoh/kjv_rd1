**Short version (2–3 sentences)**  
KJV Rightly Dividing is a free web tool: you ask a question (e.g. “How are we saved?” or “Should we tithe?”), and it shows you KJV verses grouped by Law/Israel, Jesus’ teaching, and Paul’s grace—no mixing. Link: [YOUR_URL]

**Medium version (paragraph)**  
I wanted a simple way to study the KJV without mixing law and grace. So I put together KJV Rightly Dividing: you type a question, and it returns only KJV verses, labeled by category—Paul’s grace, Jesus’ kingdom offer to Israel, Law/Israel, human traditions vs truth, and when the question touches both law and grace, a Galatians-style warning. No sign-up, no app. If you care about rightly dividing (2 Tim 2:15), you might find it useful. [YOUR_URL]

**Long version (full email)**  
Hi [Name],

2 Timothy 2:15 says to “rightly divide” the word of truth. In practice, that means not treating every verse as if it were written the same way to the same people—especially when it comes to law (Israel) and grace (the Body of Christ today).

I built a small, free web tool called **KJV Rightly Dividing** to help with that. You type a question—for example:

- “How are we saved today?”
- “Should Christians tithe?”
- “What did Jesus say about forgiveness?”

The app routes your question to the right categories and shows you only KJV verses, with clear labels: [Paul’s Grace], [Jesus’ Kingdom Offer], [Law/Israel], [Human Tradition vs Truth], and when relevant [Galatians Warning] so we don’t add works to faith.

No account, no app store—just open the link and type. If you or anyone you know wants to study the word with that kind of division in mind, here’s the link: [YOUR_URL]

Thanks,

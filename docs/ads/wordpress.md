**Body**

**“Study to shew thyself approved unto God … rightly dividing the word of truth.”** — 2 Timothy 2:15 (KJV)

If we treat every verse as if it were written the same way to the same people, we end up mixing law and grace—and that’s where a lot of confusion (and legalism) comes from.

**KJV Rightly Dividing** is a simple web app that helps you keep the divide clear.

**What it does**

- **Input:** You type a question (e.g. “How are we saved today?” “Should Christians tithe?” “What did Jesus say about forgiveness?”).
- **Routing:** The app maps your question to the right categories: Paul’s grace, Jesus’ kingdom teaching (red letters), Law/Israel, human traditions vs truth, and when relevant a Galatians-style warning about mixing law and grace.
- **Output:** Only **KJV** verses, with labels like [Paul’s Grace], [Jesus’ Kingdom Offer], [Law/Israel].

No account, no app store—just open the link and type.

**Why the categories matter**

- **Law / Israel:** Sabbath, tithing, circumcision, feasts—given to Israel; we are not under law but under grace (Rom 6:14, Col 2:14–17).
- **Jesus’ teaching:** His words to Israel in the Gospels; for the church today, Paul is our apostle (Rom 11:13, 1 Tim 2:7).
- **Paul’s grace:** Romans through Philemon—the gospel of the grace of God for the Body of Christ.
- **Galatians warning:** Adding works to faith frustrates grace (Gal 2:21).

Try it with your own questions on salvation, tithing, baptism, or Sabbath—and see how rightly dividing keeps the gospel clear.
